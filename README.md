## _Portugal, a perfect holiday destination_

Portugal, located in South Europe and bordering Spain is a unique country with a variety of activities, historical buildings, intangible heritage and spectacular views. Whether it's the indulgent cuisine, pristine beaches or history that date back thousands of years, Portugal will not fail to entertain you.

## _What does Portugal have to offer?_
Portugal is the whole package for young adults who like to travel. For the risktakers and adrenaline seekers, the _Pena Adventura Park_ is the way to go with it's extreme ziplining activity over a vast, beautiful landscape. There is also a variety of different escape rooms and waterparks. But if you're looking for something a little more historical, Portugal has immense diversification of galleries, museums and fortresses you can visit. Contrastingly, if you're just looking for a place to repose or kick-back, beaches such as _Praia da Marinha_ or _Praia de São Rafael_ will have you soaking up the sun for hours. And lastly for the "foodies", Portuguese cuisine mostly consists of delicious seafood.
